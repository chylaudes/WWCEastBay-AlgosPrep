#Exercises for WWC East Bay Problemset

Welcome to our first Women who Code East Bay Algorithms Prep.  Each week we will tackle a different common Algorithm/ Data Structure.

Feel free to work with a partner on these problems.  And we will come back to share our solutions.  

##Monday, Nov 14th -Recursion

###What is Recursion?
  It is simply when a function calls it self.

###Where do you see it?
1. Recursive Functions (Any function that calls itself)
2. Recursive Algorithms (ex. Sorting Algorithms)
3. Recursive Data Structures (ex.Trees -- trees that are composed into smaller trees and etc...)

###Why Recurison?
  - Provides an elegant solution to key your code D.R.Y.(Don't Repeat Yourself) 
  - Basic/Expected CS knowledge!
  
###How do we tackle a recursive problem?
<hr>

First we need to understand that happens when a function calls itself:

![hello](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10103582/20289013/483ea0f0-aa8c-11e6-9be6-a708f4cbc01a.png)

![max](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10103582/20289052/5dd3c026-aa8c-11e6-90d9-01cb6deceb98.png)

We can see in this example that the function hello() is calling itself and it is excuting itself infinitely.


####What do we need to do in order for us to stop it?

We need to provide some way for us to BREAK it or RETURN a VALUE.
This in other words this is called a `base case`:

![hello2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10103582/20289016/49ec5fb4-aa8c-11e6-8c43-98d693fd0f7d.png)

####Procedure:

1. Identify the Base Case
2. Identify the Recursive Case
3. Return where appropriate
4. Write procedures for each case that brings you closer to the base case

##Finished?
CONGRATS!! Give yourself a pat on the back, you must be super comfortable with recursion!

##Looking for Volunteers!

If you guys are interested in Volunteering for WWC East Bay Algorithms Prep:

Please email: **chylau.design@gmail.com**  with the subject line **"Interested in Volunteering--WWC East Bay AlgosPrep"** and write a short blurb about yourself, your programming experience, and why you would love to volunteer!  


**Disclaimer:**
Most of the material I've used is a combination of workshop classes that I've taken in the past.  I cannot take credit for the things here.  Programs that have contributed to this repo:  General Assembly, Frontend Masters/ Telegraph Academy-@bgando
